# Updateable-Bookmarks

Updatable Bookmarks allows you to update an existing bookmark with the click of a button instead of having to delete the existing bookmark and creating a new one then placing it in the exact spot of the old one.

This was invaluable to me while reading 1000+ chapter web novels on websites such as wuxiaworld.com. I hope it can be of help to some other poor souls out there.

I created this while learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Expect some jank in the code.
